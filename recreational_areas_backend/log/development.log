The other is the South Young Lake \n\nCabin.<br /><br />\n\nAccess to the cabin is float plane only. Visitors are responsible for their own travel \n\narrangements and safety and must bring several of their own amenities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nAnglers enjoy Young Lake for catching cutthroat trout, dolly varden \n\nand coho salmon. Visitors are welcome to use the skiff with oars available at the cabin and\n\nmay choose to bring a small outboard motor. The motor must be less than 10 horsepower \n\ndue to wilderness regulations, and visitors are responsible for bringing and using personal \n\nfloatation devices. The lake is normally ice-free from mid May through \n\nNovember.<br /><br />\n \nSeveral primitive trails extend from the cabin into the forest. The Admiralty Cove-Young Lake \n\ntrailhead is at the cabin's doorstep. The trail is 4.5 miles departing from the cabin and ending \n\nat Admiralty cabin and cove. It is a relatively flat trail and follows the creek at each end of the \n\ntrail. The round-trip hike can be fairly strenuous when conditions are rainy and wet.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin is a primitive, pre-cut cedar log cabin in <a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/cabins/cabin_layouts.shtml\">pan-\n\nabode style</a>, furnished with wooden bunkbeds without mattresses that sleep up to six \n\nguests. The cabin is equipped with a table, benches, an oil stove for heat and an outside \n\ntoilet. Other amenities include cooking counters, shelves, cupboard space and a \n\nbroom.<br /><br />\n\nThe cabin does not have running water or electricity, and visitors must bring their own food, \n\nwater, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cook stoves, matches, cooking gear/utensils, light \n\nsource, toilet paper, first aid kit and garbage bags.<br /><br />  \n\nGuests should bring #1 heating oil (kerosene) to fuel the stove. The stove will burn half a \n\ngallon in eight hours at the lowest setting, and up to 1.2 gallons during eight hours at the highest \n\nsetting. A flash light is handy for looking into the burn chamber when lighting the stove. \n\nMatches or a lighter are needed to light a small piece of paper to drop in to the burn \n\nchamber when lighting the stove. Detailed directions with photos on how to light the \n\nstove are provided in the cabin.<br /><br />\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tongass/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=78647&amp;actid=101\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin is situated under a canopy of old growth forest at an elevation of 320 feet, set \n\nback 50 feet from the north end of Young Lake.<br /><br />\n \nThe Kootznoowoo Wilderness encompasses nearly a million acres. Dense spruce and hemlock forests, glacier-fed streams, lakes and muskeg \n\nopenings define the landscape. Peaks rise from the horizon in the distance.<br /><br />\n\nWildlife in the area abounds. Sitka black-tailed deer stay well hidden in the dense forest and \n\nbald eagles are easily found in treetops along most beaches.

Visitors are welcome to use the skiff with oars available at the cabin and\n\nmay choose to bring a small outboard motor. The motor must be less than 10 horsepower \n\ndue to wilderness regulations, and visitors are responsible for bringing and using personal \n\nfloatation devices. The lake is normally ice-free from mid May through \n\nNovember.<br /><br />\n \nSeveral primitive trails extend from the cabin into the forest. The Admiralty Cove-Young Lake \n\ntrailhead is at the cabin's doorstep. The trail is 4.5 miles departing from the cabin and ending \n\nat Admiralty cabin and cove.

It is also in a prime spot for viewing birds and wildlife.  \n\nThe site can be accessed by float plane or boat, depending on conditions. Boats and planes should anchor in deeper water, and guests should take small skiffs or punts to the cabin. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nAnglers can fish in the Harding River for cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden from May through September, steelhead in April and May, and silver and chum salmon in August and September. Bradfield Canal offers excellent crabbing, but  tide charts  should be consulted before planning any boating or crabbing excursions.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis 14-by-16 cabin ( hunter-style ) was built in 1978 and has two single bunks and two double bunks to sleep up to six people. It is also equipped with a table and benches, broom, an oil stove for heat (No. 1 oil only) and an outhouse toilet. A food storage locker is located on the partially covered front porch.  \n\nWater and electricity are not provided. Water is available from the Harding River, but guests should be sure to treat or boil any water taken from an outside source, prior to consumption ( water safety tips ). It is recommended that guests bring their own water supply. Heating oil is not supplied by the Forest Service. In addition to bringing a supply of No. 1 stove oil, guests should pack sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a cooking stove, lanterns or flashlights, cookware, plates, utensils, food, toilet paper, garbage bags, a fire extinguisher and matches, among other necessities. Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving ( click here  for more cabin details). \n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits on relatively flat land overlooking the Harding River and Bradfield Canal. The surrounding rainforest is primarily Sitka spruce and western hemlock with scattered cedar. Muskeg is also common in the area.   \n\nBrown and black bears, harbor seals and bald eagles are often spotted around the cabin ( bear safety information ).

Easy access from the interstate and close proximity to historic Lexington and Natural Bridge State Park make Cave Mountain Lake an ideal destination.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe  7 acre lake offers opportunities for swimming in a designated area which includes a sand beach.  Fishing for youth only (ages 15 and under) is open April 1st through June 15th, then fishing is open to anglers of all ages with a valid Virginia fishing license for the remainder of the season.  There are several piers around the lake for better fishing access.  A number of opportunities for photography, birding and wildlife viewing are available along the trails and water's edge.\n  \nHiking trails surround the area, offering everything from a short walk around the lake to an all-day hike along the nearby ridges. The Panther Knob Trail starts beside the group picnic shelter and skirts the edge of the lake to the dam.  Visitors may also enjoy a day hike or backpacking trip on the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the James River Face Wilderness or the Thunder Ridge Wilderness.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe picnic shelter is a historic structure that does not support accessibility standards. Parking is available in the day-use parking area and the shelter is reached via a foot bridge and along a gravel path. \n  \nThe shelter can accommodate up to 50 people. Amenities include electricity for lights and small appliances, a fireplace, eight picnic tables under the shelter with more nearby, a double pedestal grill, trash cans and a drinking fountain with a spigot. Flush toilets and showers are available at the beach bathhouse which include showers and changing areas.  The beach area is within walking distance of the group picnic shelter.  The day use area, including the picnic shelter, closes at 9 pm or dark, whichever comes first.  The main gate on State Route 781 closes at 10 pm and visitors not camping need to exit the area before the gate closes. Guests attending events scheduled for the group picnic shelter are still responsible for the appropriate day use fee.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nCave Mountain Lake covers seven acres and was built in the late 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, using existing natural rock buttresses to form the 35-foot dam. A grassy field extends from the lake's sandy beach to  forested hills that paint a scenic backdrop.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nLexington, Virginia, just 20 minutes away, is home to several historic sites including the Stonewall Jackson House, George C. Marshall Museum and the Virignia Military Institute Museum. It's a charming town with horse drawn carriage rides through the streets. Ice and other sundries can be found at small stores along State Route 759.

The rustic environment offers a wonderfully serene and peaceful setting for your next camping experience.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nVisitors will be able to enjoy swimming, berry picking, and fishing at these campsites. Licenses are required for fishing in Michigan waters.   Some of these campsites offer only one site on these inland lakes allowing for a very peaceful and wilderness-like experience.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campsite on the eastern shore of Lake Nineteen can only be accessed by boat, or by foot or horseback from the Pine Marten Run Trail.  Like its neighbor Ironjaw Lake to the west, it is also located in the heart of the Ironjaw Semi-Primitive Area, which is managed for both motorized and non-motorized uses.  Our management efforts seek to provide for quiet, peaceful recreation opportunities in a semi-primitive setting.  The campsite is small and suitable for one family with tents.  Parking is available on the west side of the lake.  There is no toilet or drinking water at this site.  The swimming area is poor.\n  \nThe boat access to Lake Nineteen is steep, but the road is firm.  There is no turn-around at the base of the hill; trailers must back down to the lake.  Parking is restricted to a small area located at the top of the hill.  Lake Nineteen has been stocked with rainbow trout.\n  \nGroceries, gasoline, fishing and camping supplies, boat rentals, ice, MDNR licenses, deli and restaurants are available on Forest Highway 13 approximately six miles to the west and north.\n  \n \n   \n      Lake  Name   \n      Number of Sites  \n  Maximum number of people per site  \n      Toilets  \n      Boat Access  \n  Lake Size (acres)  \n   \n   \n     Lake Nineteen  \n     1 \n     8 \n     No \n Back in\n 26 \n   \n <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nAll of these sites are nestled in hardwood trees and pines.

Guests are expected to pack out trash and clean the cabin before leaving ( click here  for more cabin details). \n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits on relatively flat land overlooking the Harding River and Bradfield Canal. The surrounding rainforest is primarily Sitka spruce and western hemlock with scattered cedar. Muskeg is also common in the area.   \n\nBrown and black bears, harbor seals and bald eagles are often spotted around the cabin ( bear safety information ).

  Parameters: {"recreational_area"=>{"facility_name"=>"CAVE MOUNTAIN LAKE GROUP PICNIC SHELTER", "facility_description"=>"<h2>Overview</h2>\nCave Mountain Lake Group Picnic Shelter is nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, and welcomes visitors to enjoy the rustic beauty and peacefulness of the area. Easy access from the interstate and close proximity to historic Lexington and Natural Bridge State Park make Cave Mountain Lake an ideal destination.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe  7 acre lake offers opportunities for swimming in a designated area which includes a sand beach.  Fishing for youth only (ages 15 and under) is open April 1st through June 15th, then fishing is open to anglers of all ages with a valid Virginia fishing license for the remainder of the season.  There are several piers around the lake for better fishing access.  A number of opportunities for photography, birding and wildlife viewing are available along the trails and water's edge.\n  \nHiking trails surround the area, offering everything from a short walk around the lake to an all-day hike along the nearby ridges. The Panther Knob Trail starts beside the group picnic shelter and skirts the edge of the lake to the dam.  Visitors may also enjoy a day hike or backpacking trip on the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the James River Face Wilderness or the Thunder Ridge Wilderness.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe picnic shelter is a historic structure that does not support accessibility standards. Parking is available in the day-use parking area and the shelter is reached via a foot bridge and along a gravel path. \n  \nThe shelter can accommodate up to 50 people. Amenities include electricity for lights and small appliances, a fireplace, eight picnic tables under the shelter with more nearby, a double pedestal grill, trash cans and a drinking fountain with a spigot. Flush toilets and showers are available at the beach bathhouse which include showers and changing areas.  The beach area is within walking distance of the group picnic shelter.  The day use area, including the picnic shelter, closes at 9 pm or dark, whichever comes first.  The main gate on State Route 781 closes at 10 pm and visitors not camping need to exit the area before the gate closes. Guests attending events scheduled for the group picnic shelter are still responsible for the appropriate day use fee.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nCave Mountain Lake covers seven acres and was built in the late 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, using existing natural rock buttresses to form the 35-foot dam. A grassy field extends from the lake's sandy beach to  forested hills that paint a scenic backdrop.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nLexington, Virginia, just 20 minutes away, is home to several historic sites including the Stonewall Jackson House, George C. Marshall Museum and the Virignia Military Institute Museum. It's a charming town with horse drawn carriage rides through the streets. Ice and other sundries can be found at small stores along State Route 759.  Natural Bridge State Park is a short 8 mile drive and offers visitors views of a 215 foot tall Natural Bridge and limestone gorge, 6 miles of hiking trails, a Monacan Indian village, and  the 30 foot cascade of Lace Falls.", "facility_id"=>"233205", "facility_directions"=>"From I- 81 North, take Exit 175 just south of Natural Bridge, Virginia.
