The large lake offers endless boating, waterskiing, jet skiing, canoeing and swimming opportunities. Amity Recreation Area provides a boat ramp and swimming area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis facility is a wooded day-use area on the lake shore. There are three reservable group picnic shelters that can each accommodate up to 92 guests. A boat ramp, fishing pier, swimming area, ball field and playground provide additional recreation opportunities.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nHot, humid summers and mild, pleasant winters characterize this wooded area. A mixed pine and hardwood forest covers the site, providing summer shade and fall color. \n<br /><br />\nWildlife is abundant around the lake. Visitors might spot bald eagles, migratory waterfowl, osprey, wild turkeys and white-tailed deer.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nAugusta, Georgia, about 20 miles away, offers museums, art galleries, zoos, restaurants and shopping areas.

The large, 70,000-acre lake and its 1,000 miles of shoreline provide excellent boating, water skiing, swimming, fishing, hiking and picnicking.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThurmond Lake provides some of the best fishing, hunting and water sports in the southeastern United States. \n<br /><br />\nAnglers will find largemouth bass, bream, crappie, catfish and striped bass. The large lake offers endless boating, waterskiing, jet skiing, canoeing and swimming opportunities. Amity Recreation Area provides a boat ramp and swimming area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis facility is a wooded day-use area on the lake shore. There are three reservable group picnic shelters that can each accommodate up to 92 guests. A boat ramp, fishing pier, swimming area, ball field and playground provide additional recreation opportunities.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nHot, humid summers and mild, pleasant winters characterize this wooded area. A mixed pine and hardwood forest covers the site, providing summer shade and fall color. \n<br /><br />\nWildlife is abundant around the lake. Visitors might spot bald eagles, migratory waterfowl, osprey, wild turkeys and white-tailed deer.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nAugusta, Georgia, about 20 miles away, offers museums, art galleries, zoos, restaurants and shopping areas.
